# TASKMATE - README

Welcome to Taskmate! This repository contains the code for the backend and frontend of the Taskmate project. Follow the instructions below to run the server and explore the live website.

## Running the Server Locally
To run the backend server locally, pasted this code:
```
git clone https://github.com/me-imfhd/TASKMATE.git TASKMATE
cd backend
npm install
node index.js
```
**NOTE:** Make sure to replace the `mongoose.connect` in `index.js` with your own `mongoose.connect`

Now the Taskmate backend is up and running locally!

## Running the Frontend (Live Website)
To explore the live website deployed on Vercel, simply open the following link in your browser:
https://taksmate.vercel.app/
With the backend running locally, the website will work seamlessly.

## Running the Frontend Locally
To run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Open a new terminal (different from the one running the server).
2. Paste this code in the terminal
```
cd taskmate-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now Taskmate is running entirely on your local machine, and you are free to explore, contribute, and provide feedback!

Contributions and reviews are MOST welcomed.

Please give your feedback.

Thank You.
